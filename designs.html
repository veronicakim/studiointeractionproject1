						Kaibosh
						<br>
						Norwegian Eyewear Company
						<br>
						<br>
						Kaibosh expanded their design and brand, by creating one that offers multiple different products to their customers, other than just glasses.  They are an eyewear company, but wanted to create a brand that was more exciting and expressive. Prior to this change, they felt as if they did not offer a wide enough range of content and struggled expressing who they were and what they believed. To fix that, they took a bolder and more playful approach when designing their products, adding in more elements that were fun.  In doing so, shopping at their stores became more about the experience, as well as the great products that can be purchased there.

						Elly’s
						<br>
						High End Restaurant in Mexico City
						<br>
						<br>
						The branding of Elly’s restaurant was heavily inspired by the chef, Elly’s life experiences.  The design was created to document the experiences that led to her becoming a chef.  The story behind the restaurant heavily impacted the visual elements that were being incorporated.  There is a contrast between playful, edgy, and elegant. The graphics on the packaging, menus, and products, were inspired by Elly’s childhood memories and nostalgia.

						Yellowbelly
						<br>
						Modern Bar/Restaurant in St. Louis, MO
						<br>
						<br>
						Yellowbelly’s brand follows the creative process, which has allowed it to be very successful.  It is clear that every visual element was specifically and intentionally placed, down to the interior and atmosphere of the restaurant, menus, and website. Because it is located in the midwest and not near an island, they wanted to create a feeling that combines the two.  They gathered inspiration from French islands to create the font and graphic illustrations.  Its brand perfectly embodies the feeling of the midwest and island life.
